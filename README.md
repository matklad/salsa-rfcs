# Salsa Design RFCs

From time to time we will publish major design changes or proposals
here. There isn't really a lot of *process* per se. Before opening a
PR, though, it's a good idea to hop onto the [Salsa Zulip] and float
the idea, perhaps with a draft. RFCs should have be files with names
like `RFCNNNN-Foo-Bar.md`. You can start with [the `template.md`
file](template.md).
